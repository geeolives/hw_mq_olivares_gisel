# Repo Link
* https://github.com/geeolives/hw_mq_olivares_gisel

# Resources
* I did not use any resources outside of the lectures and my notes on this assignment.

# Comments
* I made more than 3 commits, but GitHub says I only made 3. Why does this happen? Also, I always have problems with merging documents and pushing them to the GitHub. I don't believe that what is on my GitHub page is the latest version of my project.
