# Repo Link

# Resources
* I did not use any resources outside of the lectures and my notes on this assignment.

# Comments
* I made more than 4 commits, but GitHub says I only made 4. (The other two stated there I made directly on GitHub) Why does this happen? I make commits after I create a new branch. Yet my commit for creating the desktop-first branch isn't there. Also, I always have problems with merging documents and pushing them to the GitHub. I don't believe that what is on my GitHub page is the latest version of my project.
